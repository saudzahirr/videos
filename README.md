This project contains code for animated mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science for better understanding.
All the work here is generated using community maintained version at [Manim Community](https://github.com/ManimCommunity).
Some of the animantions are based on [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), an open source scrappy python library for mathematical animation
created by Grant Sanderson. Also see his work [3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/). <br/> <br/>
The Manim Community Developers. (2022). Manim – Mathematical Animation Framework (Version v0.14.0) [Computer software]. https://www.manim.community/


## Manim Installation
```sh
pip install manim
# Manim Community Version.
```
```sh
pip install manimgl
# Manim used by 3Blue1Brown.
```
Manim runs on Python 3.6 or higher (Python 3.9 is recommended).

System requirements are [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) ([MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex)).
