This repository contains the code used to generate the explanatory math videos found on [aljabrak](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0ssVJD0ANFjmggc1vkcww).
All the work here is generated using community maintained version at [Manim Community](https://github.com/ManimCommunity).
Some of the animantions are based on [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim). <br/>
The Manim Community Developers. (2022). Manim – Mathematical Animation Framework (Version v0.15.1)

3Blue1Brown is a math YouTube channel created and run by [Grant Sanderson](https://github.com/3b1b). The channel focuses on teaching higher mathematics from a visual perspective, and on the process of discovery and inquiry-based learning in mathematics, which Sanderson calls "inventing math". Topics covered include linear algebra, calculus, artificial neural networks, the Riemann hypothesis, the Fourier transform, quaternions and topology. The visuals are predominantly generated by [Manim](https://3b1b.github.io/manim/), an open source scrappy python library for mathematical animation
created by Grant Sanderson. Also see his work [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

## Manim Installation
```sh
pip install manim
# Manim Community Version.
```
```sh
pip install manimgl
# Manim used by 3Blue1Brown.
```
Manim runs on Python 3.6 or higher (Python 3.9 is recommended).

System requirements are [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) ([MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex)).
