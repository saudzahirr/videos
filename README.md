This project contains code for animated mathematics, physics, engineering and computer science for better understanding.
All the work here is generated using community maintained version at [Manim Community](https://github.com/ManimCommunity).
Some of the animantions are based on [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), an open source scrappy python library for mathematical animation
created by Grant Sanderson. Also see his work [3blue1brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/).

# Manim Installation
```sh
pip install manim
# Manim Community Version.
```
```sh
pip install manimgl
# Manim used by 3Blue1Brown.
```
Manim runs on Python 3.6 or higher (Python 3.8 is recommended).

System requirements are [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/), [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).
